# Detection-and-Count-of-Crops-with-Drone-Simulation

Large agricultural fields are controlled by farmers manually, e.g., without any technological aid, to observe and detect possible diseases and abnormalities in crops.

By using our system, farmers will be able to observe their fields much easily and automatically, produce more healthy crops, and spend less energy and time to control their farms.
